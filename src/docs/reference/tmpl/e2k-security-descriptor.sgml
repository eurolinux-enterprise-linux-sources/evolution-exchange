<para>
Every object in the Exchange database has a security descriptor that
controls access to it. (This includes both folders and items, but
security descriptors for items are virtually always inherited from
their parent folders in well-defined ways, so we don&rsquo;t bother
thinking about them.)

<para>
The Exchange 2000 Web Storage System has a nifty sytem for translating
Windows security descriptors into XML and back, which unfortunately we
cannot use, because it's buggy. So we have to generate binary format
security descriptors, as described below.

<para>
When considering folder permissions, it is important to remember that
while the Exchange database <emphasis>looks</emphasis> like a file
system when accessed via WebDAV, it does not behave like a filesystem
internally. In particular, access to an object is controlled only by
its <emphasis>own</emphasis> security descriptor; you do not need to
have &ldquo;folder visible&rdquo; permission on an object&rsquo;s
parent in order to be able to access the object.
